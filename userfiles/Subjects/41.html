<p>Cybernetics is the branch of science dealing with artificial intelligence.<br />
A computer is basically an electronic multi tasking device which is mostly used to convert data to information (a problem solving machine)</p>

<p>Data(non tangible) - converts to - Information (tangible) using SP (source program).</p>

<p>AI(MI &ndash; machine intelligence).</p>

<p>Users of computers are known as live ware. Malware &ndash; malicious software (virus). Firmware &ndash; is a software present in a hard ware for sale/ purchasing.</p>

<p>Ransom ware &ndash; most modern computer virus. GIS &ndash; geographic information system. RADAR &ndash; Radio angle detection and ranging. GPS &ndash; global positioning system.</p>

<p>Demerits of IT:- Unemployment and unsocializing effect.</p>

<p>Lakshya and Nethra are two pilot less planes of India.</p>

<p>C &ndash; 3G language, C++ - 4G language, COBOL &ndash; 2G language.</p>

<p>The important quality of 5G computer is language recognition/ oral communication. Internet &ndash; international network. It is the widest WAN. Economic position of India &ndash; 3.</p>

<p>BCI &ndash; brain computer interface (convert brain signal to computer signal) &ndash; Open vibe is a software which do this convertion.</p>

<p>Tele &ndash; means distance. Telemedicine &ndash; distant medicine. VAN &ndash; value added network. RCN &ndash; remote communication network. WLAN &ndash; wireless local area network (WiFi &ndash; Wireless Fidelity). Bluetooth &ndash; is a short range wireless technology with which various instruments are connected (microwaves). Telemetric &ndash; long range wireless technology. India&rsquo;s most famous telemetric station &ndash; Hazan, Karnataka. Microwave is used for both of the modern communications bcz of its high frequency, so it can carry higher energy.</p>

<p>Missile station of India &ndash; Wheeler island, Chandipur &ndash; both are in Odisha.</p>

<p>Kbps &ndash; Kilo bits per second. b &ndash; bits, B &ndash; bytes.</p>

<p>Hardware is the physical peripheral visible and tangible part of the computer. A computer work based on instructions or command. A set of instructions given to the computer is called a computer program. Sequence of computer program which could be installed in a computer to do a given task is called software.</p>

<p>Qualities of the computer:-</p>

<p>Very high speed &ndash; a computer converts a command in to action in 10-6 secons.<br />
Very high accuracy or precision.<br />
High memory/ storage &ndash; Tera bytes = 102 bytes.<br />
Memory and storage are temporary and permanent respectively.<br />
Deligence (fatigue less ness) &ndash; this is the only unique property of computer different from human being.</p>

<p>Hackers and crackers are computer experts who are linked with the computer security. Hackers are the experts who will enter in to the computer system with our permission to make the features of our computer such as security better. Where are crackers are the experts who will un authentically enter in to our computer system with the intension of stealing away the valuable database present in the computer or ton destroy the precious software in it. Technically the former is called white hat and the later is called black hat.</p>

<p>Memory of the computer:-</p>

<p>A computer memory is divided in to 2 &ndash; Temporary and permanent memory. The memory which will go away if the continuous energy supply to the computer fails is known as temporary memory and the memory which will retain even if the power supply stops is known as permanent memory. Temporary memory is synonymous with the term electronic memory, semi conductor memory, RAM and volatile memory.</p>

<p>ROM &ndash; is firmware. RAM &ndash; main memory of the computer.&nbsp; The instructions of a work is currently being carried is stored in RAM.</p>
