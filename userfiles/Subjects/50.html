<p>Rainbow is due to &ndash; refraction, total internal reflection &amp; dispersion. The color seen at the outer edge is red and inner edge is violet. Outer edge of secondary rainbow is violet and inner edge is red.<br />
Mirash is due to refraction and total internal reflection.</p>

<p>In 1921 Albert Einstein was awarded Nobel Prize for physics for loss of photo electric effect. Photo electric &ndash; light in to electricity. Henrich Hertz discovered photo electric effect. Einstein explained photo electric effect with the help of Quantum theory (Max Plank). Einstein introduced photo electric effect in 1905. International year of physics &ndash; 2005. International year of chemistry &ndash; 2011.<br />
1911 &ndash; Madam Curie &ndash; Nobel prize for invention of Radium.</p>

<p>Mirror<br />
Tin amalgam used to clot on mirror.</p>

<p>Plane mirror<br />
Spherical &ndash; Concave and Convex<br />
Paraboloidal</p>

<p>If 2 plane mirrors are placed perpendicular the number of images formed &ndash; 3.&nbsp; (n = (360/a) - 1).<br />
If parallel to each other number of images is infinite. Angle of mirror decreases then the number of images increases.</p>

<p>A man is approaching an image with 10m/s then the speed of image &ndash; 20m/s.<br />
If a man of height 1.4 meter standing 2meter way from a plane mirror he should see his full image on that mirror then what should be the minimum height of the mirror?<br />
1.4/2 = 0.75</p>

<p>Right hand side of the object appears as the left hand side and vice versa &ndash; this phenomena is due to lateral inversion. The magnification (image is how many time the height of mirror) produced by a plane mirror is 1.<br />
The power of a plane mirror is 0. Focal length of a plane mirror is infinite.</p>

<p>Concave mirror &ndash; it is used by a dentist and ENT specialist, torch, head light of vehicles, shaving mirror, makeup mirror.<br />
Torch light and head light of vehicles &ndash; Paraboloidal mirror is the correct answer if this in option.<br />
Convex lens is used as rear view mirror. Convex mirror images &ndash; diminished and erect.</p>

<p>Lens<br />
Convex lens &ndash; thick at the middle and thin at the edge.<br />
Concave lens &ndash; thin at the middle and thin at the edge.<br />
Convex lens &ndash; converging lens.<br />
Concave lens &ndash; diverging lens.<br />
Power of lens &ndash; ability to bend light rays. Unit of power &ndash; diopter. As focal length increases power of a lens decreases. P &ndash; 1/F.</p>

<p>Power of a convex lens is expressed as +ve and concave lens is &ndash;ve.<br />
Camera &ndash; convex lens is used &ndash; microscope, eye lens, telescope. A camera in which no lens is used &ndash; pin hole camera. Ability of our eye lens to vary its focal length in accordance with the distance of the object we see is called power of accommodation. The muscles responsible for power of accommodation &ndash; cyliary muscles.<br />
When we see near by object &ndash; focal length is minimum.<br />
Press biopia (old site) &ndash; weakening of the cyliary muscles with age. Press biopia can be rectified by using convex lens.<br />
Short sight/ myopia &ndash; unable to see distant object s clearly &ndash; power of lens is high or size of the eye ball is big.<br />
Myopia &ndash; image of the distant object fall in front of the retina &ndash; can be rectified using concave lens.<br />
Long sight/ hyper metropia &ndash; unable to see near by objects &ndash; image of the near by object fall behind the retina &ndash; convex lens is used.<br />
Bi focal lens &ndash; Myopia + hyper metropia.<br />
Astigmatism &ndash; Eye lens fails to focus at single point at retina &ndash; can be rectified by using cylindrical lens.</p>

<p>Lever<br />
Which of the following is a first order lever &ndash; Crowbar (ans.), wheel barrow, Shovel, Nut cracker.<br />
R &ndash; resistance, E &ndash; effort, F &ndash; fulcrum.<br />
Fulcrum lies between effort and resistance &ndash; first order lever &ndash; scissor, player, see saw, crow bar, nail puller, ore of a boat, fore arm of human being, Thrass, Pulley.</p>

<p>Second order lever &ndash; resistance lies between fulcrum and effort &ndash; wheel barrow,&nbsp; nut cracker, lime screwier, bottle opener.</p>

<p>Third order lever &ndash; effort lies between fulcrum and resistance &ndash; fire tongs, ice tongs, fore seps, showel. Fishing rod, nail cutter.</p>

<p>FRE.</p>

<p>Who introduced principle of lever &ndash; Arcemedis.</p>

<p>Unit of power &ndash; Joule/ sec or watt.<br />
1 horse power &ndash; 746watt.<br />
Power of machine &ndash; horse power (hp).</p>
