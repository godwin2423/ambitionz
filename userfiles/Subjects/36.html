<p>1. Early sunrise is due to &ndash; Refraction.<br />
2. The brilliance of a diamond is due to &ndash; total internal reflection.<br />
3. The beautiful color seen on a soap bubble is due to &ndash; Interference.<br />
4. The colour seen at the outer edge of rainbow is &ndash; red.<br />
5. When yellow color is mixed with magenta the color of the pigment obtained is &ndash; red.</p>

<p>Refraction<br />
Density = mass/ volume<br />
Density of water &ndash; 1000kg/ m3&nbsp;(1gm/ c3), air &ndash; 1.3 kg/ m3, Mercury &ndash; 13600 kg/ m3, ice &ndash; 920 kg/m3<br />
Relative density of mercury &ndash; 13.6 (13.6 x 1000 = 13600).<br />
The relative density of a substance is 2 then what is its density &ndash; 2 x 1000 = 2000.<br />
Hygrometer is used to find the relative density. It is the actual amount of water vapor present in the&nbsp;air to the amount of water vapour required to saturate.<br />
Barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. Sudden fall in barometer indicated storm.&nbsp;Barometer is invented by Torricelli.&nbsp;760mm of Hg (105&nbsp;&nbsp;pascal)(1 bar) &ndash; standard atmospheric pressure or atmospheric pressure in sea&nbsp;level. Unit of atmospheric pressure &ndash; Pascal.</p>

<p>The bending of light rays when it enter from one medium to another medium obliquely is called&nbsp;refraction.&nbsp;Twinkling of starts is due to atmospheric refraction. A scale appears to be bend when it is dipped in&nbsp;water due to refraction. A pond looks shallow due to refraction of light. Early sun rise and late sun&nbsp;set are due to refraction.</p>

<p>Scattering<br />
White color of cloud is due to scattering. Blue color of sky is due to scattering. Astraunants see sky in&nbsp;black color &ndash; bcz there is no atmosphere so no scattering. Sky in moon &ndash; looks dark &ndash; bcz of no&nbsp;atmosphere. Scattering of light depends upon wavelength if the size of the obstacle is smaller than&nbsp;wavelength.<br />
Violet &ndash; low wavelength so max scattering. Red &ndash; high wavelength so min scattering.<br />
CV. Raman explained the reason for blue color of ocean &ndash; it is due to scattering of light. CV. Raman&nbsp;declared Raman Effect on 1928 Feb 28 &ndash; National science day.<br />
Second Indian who got Nobel prize for physics &ndash; S. Chandra sekhar &ndash; 1983 &ndash; for Chandra sekhar limit&nbsp;&ndash; 1.44 times solar mass.</p>

<p>Blue color of sky was explained by &ndash; Lord Rayleigh. Rayleigh law of scattering &ndash; Scattering &prop; 1/ &lambda;4&nbsp;(if wavelength is high min scattering).<br />
Yellow light is used in fog lamps &ndash; high wavelength so min scattering. The rising sun and setting sun&nbsp;appears yellow, orange, red due to scattering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total Internal Reflection<br />
Water &ndash; 49 deg, Glass &ndash; 42 deg, diamond &ndash; 25 deg.<br />
Light ray must enter from denser to rarer medium. Angle of incidence in the denser must be &gt;&nbsp;critical angle. Angle of incidence in the denser medium for which angle of refraction is 90 deg is&nbsp;called critical angle.<br />
The brilliance of light is due to total internal reflection/ multiple reflection. Shining of dew drops in&nbsp;the morning is due to total internal reflection.&nbsp;Endoscope is a device used to observe the internal organs of our body &ndash; total internal reflection. The&nbsp;phenomenon of light used in bicycle reflector &ndash; total internal reflection.</p>

<p>Interference<br />
Monochromatic waves &ndash; same wavelength. Eg: Laser, sodium vapour lamp.<br />
When two monochromatic waves super imposes their amplitudes gets added up vectorially, this&nbsp;phenomenon is called interference.<br />
Mercury vapor &ndash; white, Neon &ndash; orange, nitrogen &ndash; red, chlorine &ndash; green, hydrogen &ndash; blue, sodium&nbsp;vapor &ndash; yellow.<br />
Soap bubble color is due to interference. Color seen on thin film on road &ndash; interference. CD/ DVD &ndash;&nbsp;interference/ defraction.&nbsp;</p>
