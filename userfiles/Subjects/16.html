<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the body to control and coordinate the various physiological activities in the system is nervous system.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 3 types of nervous system &ndash;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Central nervous system<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Peripheral nervous system<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Autonomic nervous system<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Central nervous includes Bran and the spinal cord.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nerve that arrives from the brain is called the cranial nerve.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves in the body.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nerve that arrives from the spinal code is called spinal nerve.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves in human body.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 43 pairs of nerves in human body.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Largest nerve in human body &ndash; Vagus nerve.<br />
10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Smallest nerve in human body &ndash; Pathetic Trochlear.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Peripheral nerve system includes 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves.<br />
12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nerve chains on either side of the vertebral column is called Autonomic nerve system.<br />
13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Autonomic nervous system includes Sympathetic and Para sympathetic nervous system.<br />
14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Central nervous system is called secretariat of the government.<br />
15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The structural and functional unit of nervous system is called Neuron.</strong></p>

<p><strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Longest cell in the human body is Neuron.<br />
17.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Largest cell in the world &ndash; Ostrich egg.(1.78kg)<br />
18.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weight of egg of a hen &ndash; 50gm<br />
19.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Smallest cell in the word &ndash; PPLO (Pluro Pneumonia Like Organism)(Micro plasma)<br />
20.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Largets cell in the human body &ndash; Ovum(0.2mm)</strong></p>

<p><strong>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Smallest cell in the human body &ndash; Sperm (0.06mm)<br />
22.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nerve filament that arrives from the neuron is called Dentron.<br />
23.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The branches of Dentron is called Dentrites.<br />
24.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long nerve filament that arrives from the cell body is called Axon.<br />
25.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Branches of Axon is called Axonite. Axon is covered with a double large membrane known as Milne sheeth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A functional join between 2 adjacent neuron is called Synapse.<br />
27.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Synapse produce a chemical substance known as Acetyl colline.<br />
28.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is Nerve? Nerve is formed by the union of several nerve fibres. Nerve fibres are Axon and they are enveloped by a covering made of lipids. That is called nerve.<br />
29.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carry sensory impulse from the receptors to brain or spinal cord is called Sensory nerves. Eg: for Sensory nerves &ndash; Optic nerve, Auditory nerve, Olfactory nerve.<br />
30.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 3 pairs of Sensory nerves.</strong></p>

<p><strong>31.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carry motor impulse from the brain or spinal cord to different parts of the body is called Motor nerves. Eg for Motor nerve &ndash; Hypo glosel nerve.<br />
32.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 5 pairs of Motor nerve in the human body.<br />
33.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Union of Sensory nerve and Motor nerve is called Mixed nerve. Eg for Mixed nerve &ndash; Vagus nerve.<br />
34.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 4 pairs of Mixed nerve in human body<br />
35.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Length of a spinal cord &ndash; 45 cm.<br />
36.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 8 pairs of Cervical nerve in human body. 12 pairs of Thoraxic nerve in human body. 5 pairs of Lumbar nerve in human body. 5 pairs of Sacral nerves in human body. 1 pair of coccygeal nerve in human body.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brain<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most important organ in human body &ndash; Brain.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brain is located in Cranium.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weight of the brain is 1400gm.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sperm whale has the largest brain.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blue whale has the largest heart.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heart beat Blue whale &ndash; 5-6 times in 1 min. Elephant has the largest heart on land (25 times per min)<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heart beat of a normal man &ndash; 72 times per min.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heart beat rare of women &ndash; 78 times.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brain is covered by 3 layered membrane known as Meninges.<br />
10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In between the Meninges there lies a fluid known as Cerebral Spinal Fluid(CSF)</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain (85%)<br />
12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The outer part of the Cerebrum is called &ndash; Grey matter (Cortex)<br />
13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inner part of the Cerebrum is White matter (Medula)<br />
14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grey matter contain Neuron.<br />
15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;White matter contain nerve filament.</strong></p>

<p><strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nervous band that connecting the cerebral hemi spheres together known as Corpus collosum.<br />
17.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebrum contains the voluntary action.<br />
18.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Intelligence, memory, vision, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting, presence of mind, imagination, speeching &ndash; center for Cerebrum.<br />
19.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second largest part in the brain is Cerebellum.<br />
20.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebellum controls the body balancing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebellum controls the muscle movement.<br />
22.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebellum is called the little brain.<br />
23.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cerebellum will be affected by Alcohol.<br />
24.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Medulla Oblongata controls the involuntary actions.<br />
25.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Respiration is controlled by Medulla Oblongata.</strong></p>

<p><strong>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hypothalamus is called Thermo regulatory center.<br />
27.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hungry, taste, water balancing, body temperature are controlled by Hypothalamus.<br />
28.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thalamus is called the relay station.<br />
29.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thalamus is affected by pain killers.</strong></p>
