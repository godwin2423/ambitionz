Composition of gases in the atmosphere &ndash; Nitrogen (75%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (1%), Co2 (0.03%).</p>

<p>Layers :-<br />
Troposphere &ndash; 16km &ndash; life exists only here, climate changes occur only here.<br />
Stratosphere &ndash; 16-50km &ndash; ozone layer is situated here. Height of ozone layer 25-50 km. This area is known as ozonosphere.<br />
Ozone layer invented on 1913 &ndash; Charles Fabry and Henry &ndash; forms with the help of UV radiation.<br />
UV radiation are of 3 types &ndash; UV A, UV B, UV C. UV C is dangerous but not reached to earth.<br />
Health problems related to UV A &amp; B radiation &ndash; Skin cancer, gene mutation, cataract, snow blindness.</p>

<p>The international protocol signed to protect ozone layer &ndash; Montrial protocol &ndash; 1987 Sep 16 &ndash; came into force in 1989. World ozone day is Sep 16.<br />
Ozone depletion &ndash; C(Carbon), F (florin), C (clorin) &ndash; most ozone depletion gas is clorin.<br />
1985 Dec &ndash; first ozone hole was detected over Antartiac.<br />
GM. Dobson discovered that ozone layer absorbs UV radiation. Instrument used to measure ozone thickness &ndash; Toms. Unit &ndash; Dobson unit (DU)</p>

<p>Thermosphere &ndash; hottest layer &ndash; this is also known as ionosphere &ndash; artificial satellites are orbiting through thermosphere. Now International Space Station is here. Commander &ndash; Sunitha Williams.<br />
Imaginary line separates earth and space &ndash; Karman line.</p>

<p>Global warming<br />
International agreement to reduce global warming - Kyoto protocol &ndash; 1997 Dec 11 &ndash; came in to force in 2005 &ndash; signed in Japan.</p>

<p>First green house gas emitter &ndash; China, second &ndash; America, third &ndash; India.<br />
Global warming is caused by green house gases &ndash; Co2, methane, oxides of nitrogen, CFC, water vapor, etc.<br />
Main radiation caused by global warming &ndash; infrared.<br />
Main impact of global warming &ndash; climate change.</p>

Accumulation of pesticides in living bodies through pest change &ndash; Bio magnification.<br />
Biomagnification is exhibited by heavy metals and pesticides.</p>

<p>BOD &ndash; Bio oxygen demand &ndash; highly polluted water exhibit high BOD.<br />
Endosalfan &ndash; affects nerve system and endo brain system &ndash; genetic defects and physical defects.<br />

<p>Industrial disease<br />
1. Meenamatta disease &ndash; caused by methane mercury &ndash; affects nerve system.<br />
2. Ithai-ithai &ndash; caused by Cadmium &ndash; affects Skelton system.<br />
3. Black foot disease &ndash; caused by Arsenic.<br />
4. Blue boy syndrome &ndash; caused by Nitrate.<br />

<p>Acid rain &ndash; is caused by sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide &ndash; destroy plants and monuments.<br />
Sulphur dioxide + rain water = sulphuric acid.<br />
Nitrogen dioxide + rain water = nitric acid.</p>
