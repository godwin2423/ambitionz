1 Fathom = 6 feet.<br />
1 mile = 1.609 km.</p>

<p>21. Electro-magnetic spectrum &ndash; in electro-magnetic spectrum, the electro-magnetic waves are&nbsp;arranged in the descending order of their wavelength.&nbsp;AC, Radio, Micro, Infra red, Light, Ultra violet, X-ray, Gamma.&nbsp;ARM &ndash; ILU &ndash; XG<br />
22. The frequency of AC used in our country &ndash; 50Hz.<br />
23. In our country AC is usually distributed at a voltage of 220-240volt.<br />
24. In our country AC is usually generated at a voltage of 11KV.<br />
25. The device used to covert AC to DC &ndash; rectifier.</p>

<p>26. DC to AC &ndash; Oscillator.<br />
27. To change the voltage of AC &ndash; Transformer.<br />
28. Unit of capacitance &ndash; Farad.&nbsp;1 Pico Farad = 1012 Farad.<br />
29. Radio wave &ndash; used for radio communication and TV communication. It is used in radars (in&nbsp;powerful radars micro waves are used).<br />
30. The device used to measure distance by using radio wave &ndash; RADAR (Radio detection and&nbsp;Ranging)&nbsp;- invented by A.H. Taylor and Leo C. Young.</p>

<p>31. SONAR &ndash; Sound navigation and ranging. In SONAR ultrasonic sound is used. It is used to&nbsp;measure the depth of ocean.<br />

LASER &ndash; light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Discovered by Maiman.<br />
34. Infrared radiation &ndash; The heating effect of sunlight caused by infrared radiation. Thermo pile&nbsp;is a device used to detect the presence of IR radiation. It is used in remote controls, long&nbsp;distance photography, night vision cameras.&nbsp;Infra red radiation has some visibility but doesn&rsquo;t affect photographic films so used for&nbsp;washing.<br />
35. UV radiation &ndash; used for water purification. It is used to test the purity of gems. It is used to&nbsp;detect fake currency.</p>

<p>36. Fluorescence &ndash; the ability of a substance to absorb UV radiation (shorter wave length) and&nbsp;emit light radiation (longer wave length). Eg of fluorescent material is zinc sulphide.<br />
Note: Ozone layer &ndash; stratosphere.<br />
The darkening of skin due to long exposure to sunlight by the action of UV radiation is called&nbsp;sun burn.<br />
