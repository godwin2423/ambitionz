<p><strong>If Clause&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A clause contains subject and verb. Clauses can be mainly classified in to 2:</p>

<p>Main (Principal) (പൂർണം) -&nbsp;A full stop can be put after a clause.<br />
Subordinate clause -&nbsp;A full stop cannot be put after a clause. The word used to make a clause subordinate is used only at the beginning of the sentence.</p>

<p>Eg: I saw him when I reached home.&nbsp;Which is the subordinate clause?</p>

<p>I saw her/&nbsp;I reached home/&nbsp;I saw him when/&nbsp;None of these</p>
