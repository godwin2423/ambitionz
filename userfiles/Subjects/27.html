1. Sodium Citrate &ndash; used a preservative for human blood. Potassium citrate, Ammonium citrate are also&nbsp;used for the same purpose.<br />
2. Phosphoric acid &ndash; The bristle effervescence of soda or cola is produced by the dissolved presence of&nbsp;phosphoric acid in it. The excess phosphoric acid effect destroys bones.<br />
3. Oxalic acid- Natural source is banana, pepper, tomato. It is widely used for the manufacture of&nbsp;chocolates. It is a major ingredient in washing soap powder due to its stain remover property.<br />
4. Nitric acid &ndash; Nitric acid gives yellow color to protein, called xanthoprotic test. Lunar caustic &ndash;silver&nbsp;nitrate which is used to make voting ink/marking ink.<br />
5. Wonder metal &ndash; Titanium is called wonder metal. It is also called metal of the future. Titanium is used&nbsp;to make aircraft, sub marines, marine engine, turbine engine. Titanium is extracted in Kerala from&nbsp;illuminate present in black sand. Titanium dioxide is the whitest compound ever known used to make&nbsp;white paint. Its refractive index is higher than diamond. Lunar metal is Titanium.</p>

<p>6. Wonder drug &ndash; Aspirin is called so. The chemical name of aspirin is Acetyl Salicylic acid , invented by&nbsp;Felix Hoffman(1905). It is early used as analgesic.<br />
7. Tranquilizer &ndash; The chemical which is used against mental disorderness.&nbsp;<br />
eg: Barbituric acid, Secanal.<br />
Barbituric acid is also used for hypnotism.<br />
8. Boric acid &ndash; It is a mild antiseptic, hence used as eye lotion. It is also an ingredient in ailments in&nbsp;wounds, cut and burn. It is also used as polishing powder in caroms board.<br />
9. Hydrogen &ndash; The most abundant element is the universe. Second is Helium. The atomic number and&nbsp;mass number of Hydrogen is same (1). The element which can produce largest number of compounds&nbsp;(second is carbon). Hydrogen fuel has highest efficiency. The fuel of the future is hydrogen. Hydrogen&nbsp;is considered as green fuel (Eco-friendly fuel). Rocket fuel is Hydrogen.&nbsp;Hydrogen economy &ndash; The power of CNG or LNG is increased by the addition of 5% LHG (liquefied&nbsp;hydrogen gas) and used as automobile fuel from heavy vehicles in Delhi. Hydrogen economy country&nbsp;is India.<br />
10. Helium &ndash; The smallest atom or element is Helium. The element with lowest energy. Alfa particle is&nbsp;Helium nucleus. Helium gas is used in aircraft tyres (highly non inflammable). Deep sea diverse use a&nbsp;mixture of Helium and Oxygen for breathing in order to avoid muscular fatigue. Carbogen (mixture of&nbsp;carbon &amp; oxygen) is used for artificial respiration.</p>

<p>11. 11. Ethylene Glycol (Glycol) &ndash; It is used as anti freeze.<br />
12. Anti knock &ndash; The chemical which used to increase the efficiency of fuel like petrol, diesel, etc.&nbsp;TEL &ndash; Tetra ethyl led, BTX &ndash; benzene toluene and xylene<br />
13. Glycerin (Glycerol) &ndash; It is a major ingredient in creams and oils, due to its hygroscopic (absorb&nbsp;moisture) nature. It is used to make transparent soap.<br />
14. Silicon &ndash; The most abundant element by mass present in earth&rsquo;s crust. It is used to make solar panels.&nbsp;Silica &ndash; Silicon Dioxide &ndash; SiO2. Quartz is also silicon dioxide. Artificial rock is silicon carbide&nbsp;(Carborandum). The most abundant element present in earth&rsquo;s crust is Oxygen. The most abundant&nbsp;metal present in earth&rsquo;s crust is Aluminium. The most abundant metal on earth is Iron. CD is&nbsp;manufacture by using Aluminium.<br />
15. 15. Antiseptics &ndash; The chemical generally used to destroy micro organism. The antiseptic used in toilet&nbsp;soap is Bithnol. Antiseptic used in lotion is Phenol. Anti septic used in toothpaste is Sorbitol.</p>

<p>Chapter 2<br />
1. Haber Process &ndash; Manufacture of Ammonia from Nitrogen and Hydrogen by using the catalyst iron.&nbsp;Ammonia generally used in refrigerator in olden times. Freon 21 is using now in refrigerators.&nbsp;Ammonia can easily converted in to Urea. Urea &ndash; a nitrogenous fertilizer generally consumed by&nbsp;paddy, sugar cane, corn, vegetables.<br />
2. Cyanide process &ndash; Extraction of gold, here sodium cyanide solution is used.<br />
3. Contact process &ndash; Manufacture of sulphuric acid by using the catalyst vanadium pentoxide. The&nbsp;largest producing acid in the world is sulphuric acid. Sulphiric acid is used for the production of&nbsp;automobile batteries. Sulphuric acid is also called as oil of vitriol. It is a strong dehydrating agent.<br />
White vitrol &ndash; Zinc sulphate (paint manufaturing)<br />
Blue vitrol &ndash; Copper sulphate (Bordaux mixture)<br />
Green vitrol &ndash; Ferrous sulphate or Iron sulphate. It is used for the production of fountain pen ink.<br />
In Kerala sulphuric acid is manufactured by FACT. Sulphate fertilizers are produced from sulphuric<br />
acid.eg: factomphos.</p>

<p>4. Bosch process &ndash; Manufacture of Hydrogen from water.<br />
5. Solvey process &ndash; It is used for the manufacture of baking soda (sodium bi carbonate)<br />
6. Castener Kellner &ndash; It is used for the production of caustic soda (Sodium Hydroxide), which is used for&nbsp;the production washing soap.<br />
7. Esterfication &ndash; manufacture of Ester (essence) from organic acid and alcohol.<br />
8. Bessemer process &ndash; manufacture of steel/ extraction of copper.<br />
9. LD process &ndash; It is recycling process, steel is manufactured from scrap.<br />
10. Ostwald process &ndash; Manufacture of nitric acid from Ammonia.<br />
(Atom term was given by Ostawld)</p>

<p>Phenomena<br />
1. Adsorption/Occlusion &ndash; it is a surface phenomena in which one kind of molecule adsorb on the&nbsp;surface of another.<br />
eg: Large quantity of Hydrogen adsorb on the surface of Paladium.<br />
2. Sublimation &ndash; solid -&gt; heat -&gt; vapor -&gt; cool -&gt; solid (no liquid state)<br />
eg: Camphor, Naphthalene, Ammonium chloride, dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), Iodin.&nbsp;</p>
