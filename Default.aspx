            WPF lacks built-in 3D shapes such as sphere, cylinder and cube. In result, those who intend to add such shapes to their 3D scene have no choice rather than generating their mesh through additional coding. As I've already googled and searched through CodeProject for a simple solution for generating a sphere in WPF, I didn't find a clear code that I could rely on for a serious project. Some of them too long others with limitations and ambiguity.  The code that I submit here generates a triangle list and their normal vectors for a sphere with unit radius which can be then moved and resized by simple calculations. It’s written in VB.Net and can be easily converted to other .Net based languages. </p>
